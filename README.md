# fraud-detection-federated

> A privacy-preserving fraud detection system using federated learning to analyze transaction patterns across distributed financial institutions without sharing raw data.

---

## Overview

This project introduces a novel approach to fraud detection in the financial sector using **federated learning**, allowing multiple banks or payment processors to collaboratively train AI models without exposing sensitive customer data. The system is built with real-time applicability and regulatory compliance in mind, providing a modern, secure framework for cross-institutional fraud intelligence.

---

## Key Features

- Detects fraudulent patterns using federated neural networks across distributed data nodes
- Supports privacy-preserving computation without centralized data pooling
- Includes synthetic test data for evaluation and simulation
- Extensible design to integrate with real-time payment APIs

---

## Innovation & Novelty

This is one of the **first open-source prototypes** to simulate real-time fraud detection in a **federated learning** context for the financial industry. It avoids data centralization by keeping customer data **on-device** or **on-prem**, aligning with GDPR and financial compliance standards.

The architecture and algorithms were fully designed and developed by **Rahul Autade**. This work addresses a critical challenge in global fintech operations: **how to collaborate on fraud prevention without violating data privacy laws**.

## Impact & Adoption

-  Demonstrates a working framework for institutions to evaluate federated fraud models
-  Applicable to banks, payment gateways, and e-wallet platforms
-  Forms the basis for future AI-based fraud engines in high-risk transactional environments
