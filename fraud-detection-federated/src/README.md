# Federated Fraud Detection â€“ Source Code Reference

This directory contains the full set of source files used in the **fraud-detection-federated** system. Each module in this directory is designed to support training, evaluation, preprocessing, and deployment of machine learning models for fraud detection in a simulated federated environment.

##  Source Files Overview

###  Federated Training
- **`federated_train.py`**  
  Orchestrates federated learning across multiple clients using TensorFlow Federated. Includes model aggregation, training rounds, and evaluation on combined data.

- **`client_simulator.py`**  
  Splits the dataset and simulates local datasets for multiple federated clients. Includes support for stratified and randomized splitting.

###  Model Building & Training
- **`model_builder.py`**  
  Builds and compiles Keras models with support for simple, wide, and deep architectures. Optimizer, loss, and input shape are configurable.

- **`trainer.py`**  
  Trains a Keras model on local data. Includes callbacks like early stopping, model checkpointing, and optional visualizations of training curves.

###  Evaluation & Inference
- **`evaluator.py`**  
  Evaluates model performance on test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC and PR curves.

- **`model_inference.py`**  
  Loads a trained model and performs inference on new transactions (manually defined or CSV-based). Supports CLI arguments and probability thresholding.

###  Data Handling
- **`data_loader.py`**  
  Loads and preprocesses raw transaction data. Includes encoding, scaling, validation, and splitting for training and testing.

- **`preprocessing.py`**  
  Applies normalization (MinMax or Standard scaling). Includes options to save/load scalers and run from CLI with CSV input/output.

###  Testing
- **`test_main.py`**  
  Runs unit tests to verify data integrity, schema compliance, and functionality of the analysis scripts.

###  Utilities
- **`utils.py`**  
  Logging and metrics utilities. Displays and saves metrics, classification reports, and plots confusion matrices.

- **`main.py`**  
  CLI entry point for data exploration, risk analysis, and visualization. Supports commands like `--summary`, `--fraud`, `--charts`.

##  Usage Instructions

```bash
python src/main.py --summary --fraud --charts
```

##  New Extended Modules

- **`feature_engineering.py`**  
  Handles custom transformations, feature selection, and domain-specific fraud indicators.

- **`hyperparameter_tuning.py`**  
  Automates grid search and random search strategies for model optimization.

- **`data_augmentation.py`**  
  Generates synthetic variations of existing transaction data to improve generalization.

- **`visualization_tools.py`**  
  Contains reusable visualization functions for EDA, comparison plots, and learning curves.

- **`synthetic_data_generator.py`**  
  Creates large-scale synthetic transaction datasets using statistical rules or GANs.

- **`federated_metrics.py`**  
  Computes per-client and global metrics during and after federated rounds.

- **`client_manager.py`**  
  Manages client configurations, data access, and local computation logic.

- **`deployment_utils.py`**  
  Scripts to export models and preprocessors for deployment in cloud or edge environments.

- **`explainability.py`**  
  Provides SHAP/Grad-CAM-based explainability for black-box model decisions.

- **`monitoring_dashboard.py`**  
  Backend logic for serving training and inference metrics on a live dashboard.
