# Readme placeholder for src


### 📁 `src/` Directory

This folder contains the core source code for the **fraud-detection-federated** project. It includes scripts for preprocessing data, simulating federated learning, evaluating results, and testing.

---

#### 📄 Contents:

* `main.py`
  A simple script that loads the dataset and calculates basic fraud statistics.

* `federated_train.py`
  The main script that sets up and runs a federated learning simulation using TensorFlow Federated across multiple simulated clients.

* `test_main.py`
  A unit test script to ensure data format and labeling are valid before training.

---

#### 📌 Purpose:

These files represent the technical foundation of the project:

* Showcasing **original algorithm design**
* Demonstrating **federated architecture implementation**
* Supporting **model evaluation and reproducibility**
