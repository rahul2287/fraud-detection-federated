# Readme for models


### `models/` Directory

This folder contains trained or exported machine learning models generated during the simulation of federated fraud detection.

---

####  Contents:

* `federated_model.h5` *(optional)* – Placeholder for a locally trained Keras model
* `federated_model_saved/` – Directory generated by `federated_train.py`, containing the final global model saved in TensorFlow's standard format

---

####  Purpose:

These models represent the output of collaborative training across multiple clients in a federated setup. They can be used for:

* Inference testing
* Performance evaluation
* Future retraining or fine-tuning

---

>  All models in this directory are trained on **synthetic data** and are intended for demonstration or research purposes only.
