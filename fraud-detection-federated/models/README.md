# Readme for models


### üìÅ `models/` Directory

This folder contains trained or exported machine learning models generated during the simulation of federated fraud detection.

---

#### üìÑ Contents:

* `federated_model.h5` *(optional)* ‚Äì Placeholder for a locally trained Keras model
* `federated_model_saved/` ‚Äì Directory generated by `federated_train.py`, containing the final global model saved in TensorFlow's standard format

---

#### üìå Purpose:

These models represent the output of collaborative training across multiple clients in a federated setup. They can be used for:

* Inference testing
* Performance evaluation
* Future retraining or fine-tuning
